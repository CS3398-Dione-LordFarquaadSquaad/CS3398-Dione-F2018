# CS3398-Dione-F2018
Status of Project:
- UI: The solve menu is nearly complete, and will be upon linking the menu with the solving algorithm. Create menu is also still a WIP.
- SolveAlg: The solving algrithm is nearly complete, and will be upon printing the solution to a file.

Next Steps:
Ryan:   1. Finish the solve menu, specifically the solution screen upon clicking the solve button.
        2. Resize the windows to allow for bigger grids.

Hunter: 1. Finish the create menu to allow users to create their own nonograms.

Laura and Robyn:  1. Finish and debug the solving algorithm.

All:    1. Link all the currently seperate components into one program, then cooperate to add the remaining main features.
