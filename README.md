# CS3398-Dione-F2018
Status of Project:
- UI: Still in development. Hunter and Ryan are currently working on making the grid editable for the "Solve" menu.
- Solving algorithm: Still in development. Laura and Robyn are currently working out bugs so the algorithm will function precisely.
- Note: There have been MANY setbacks due to other courses (assignments, tests, homework, other group projects, etc.).

Next Steps:
Ryan:   1. Make a cleaner version of the menus (so the menus themselves will be a little more eye-candyish).
        2. Work with Hunter to create a grid with editable parameters in a format where the algorithm can read it.

Hunter: 1. Work with Ryan to create a grid with editable parameters in a format where the algorithm can read it.

Laura:  1. Finish the algorithm that will solve the nonogram and display the result.

Robyn:  1. Finish the algorithm that will solve the nonogram and display the result.

All:    1. Once the UI and algorithm are finished, we will come together to put the pieces together; make the UI work with the alrogithm.
