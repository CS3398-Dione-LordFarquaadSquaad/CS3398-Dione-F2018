Project Status:
  Hunter's and Ryan's menus were merged successfully into one complete menu. DrawSolution (Ryan) to Algo (Laura and Robyn) integration is still not running as intended.

Next Steps (if there were to be a Sprint 4, this is what we would've done):
- Ryan: Make the menu look nicer and get DrawSolution working with Algo.
- Robyn:
- Laura:
- Hunter:

Team Contributions/Artifacts:
- Ryan:
  - DrawNonogram.java - Takes information about the nonogram and draws the grid and text fields for editing. This process is started upon clicking Solve in the program. Found in master branch; JavaApplication7/src/menu/DrawNonogram.java
  - DrawSolution.java - Passes entered markers of nonogram to Algo.java, then takes the solution and draws it. This process is started upon clicking the finalization button in the Solve menu. Found in master branch; JavaApplication7/src/menu/DrawSolution.java
  - Nonogram.java - Intended to save data of the grid for solve menu and allow for personalization and editing. Exception failures prevented this during merging of menu, and is currently omitted from the program.  Found in master branch; JavaApplication7/src/menu/Nonogram.java
